    },

      "question": "Is Paraná suitable for first-time immigrants?",
      "answer": "Yes, if you plan for local realities like climate, job market size, and language needs. It is less suitable for those needing very large urban networks."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can I work with a tourist entry?",
      "answer": "No. Working without authorization can lead to denial of future applications."

      "question": "Where do I register after arrival?",
      "answer": "Registration is handled by the Federal Police, primarily in Curitiba. Appointments and documents are required."
    },
    {
      "question": "Is it better to arrive before securing housing?",
      "answer": "Short-term housing is safer initially. Long-term leases are easier after you have CPF and local documentation."

      "question": "How soon can I move from Curitiba to Curitiba?",
      "answer": "After you complete initial registration steps. Moving earlier can complicate proof-of-address requirements."
    },
    {
      "question": "Do I need a local guarantor for rent?",
      "answer": "Often yes. Alternatives include higher deposits or corporate housing, depending on the landlord."

      "question": "Is public healthcare enough for newcomers?",
      "answer": "Public services exist, but many newcomers choose private plans to reduce wait times."

      "question": "Can I sign a lease without local credit history?",
      "answer": "Yes, but expect higher deposits or a local guarantor. Temporary housing is common first."

      "answer": "Some categories require the original employer or sponsor. Changes may require a new process."
