      "question": "Is Ceará suitable for first-time immigrants?",
      "answer": "Yes, if you plan for local realities like climate, job market size, and language needs. It is less suitable for those needing very large urban networks."

      "question": "Can I work with a tourist entry?",
      "answer": "No. Working without authorization can lead to denial of future applications."

      "answer": "Registration is handled by the Federal Police, primarily in Fortaleza. Appointments and documents are required."

      "question": "Do I need a local guarantor for rent?",
      "answer": "Often yes. Alternatives include higher deposits or corporate housing, depending on the landlord."

      "answer": "Public services exist, but many newcomers choose private plans to reduce wait times."
